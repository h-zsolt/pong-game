# Pong Feedback

##### Your task was to create your own version of the classic Pong game.

# Planning and Documentation

- [x] UML diagram present
- [x] Pseudocode/flowchart for collision detection algorithm

**Notes:** You could have used vectors in the paddle and ball to represent both velocities and positioning, but your candidate classes are sound. Your pseudocode bare. For example, how does one `Find meeting point`

# Gameplay

#### Basic Requirements: At Good Standard

- [x] Working menu screen
- [x] 2 player game
- [x] Collision detection implemented
- [x] Paddle movement
- [x] Scoring system

#### Other Functionality

- [x] Win and lose states
- [x] Replay options
- [x] Working extensions to the base requirements

**Notes:** The game is fully playable and you've got to some effort to include additional game-play modes (though arcade did not work on my machine). I love the friction applied to the paddles, though I think even in the basic mode that the experience could be improved by reducing the friction slightly and speeding the ball up. You have an issue with the presentation of the game.

# Implementation

- [x] Well structured and easy to follow
- [ ] Correct use of the coding standard
- [x] Good use of object orientated design
- [x] No memory leaks present
- [x] Use of delta time
- [ ] Passed Travis build checks

**Notes:** I generally found the design of the code-base to be sensible. The classes were used well. You have shown an understanding of dynamic memory management, objects and logic checking. You haven't really followed the coding standard too closely and at times I found the dense nature of your code to be very difficult to read. It could be better formatted. There's still plenty of scope for refactoring also. 

# Marking

Your grade and the breakdown is shown below. The weightings for each component are shown in brackets.

| Component                                           | MARKS       |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Problem analysis (UML, pseudo-code/flowchart) (10%) | 56.23%      |
| Playability and runs as expected (50%)              | 65.00%      |
| Technical implementation (40%)                      | 73.00%      |
|                                                     | ----------- |
| **Total**                                           | **67.32%**  |

The three components total 100%. 
This assignment contributes **20%** of your portfolio mark.

#### Additional Feedback

> Well done, you have shown an aptitude for coding. You need to concentrate on your gameplay more and presentation as the technical implementation is just one part of the final grade. Please try to make your code a little easier to read by using the occasional line break.
